## Original Clock Details

Face is inscribed with 'EDWARD', 'GLASGOW' and 'PULSYNETIC'.

Mechanism and case are inscribed 'EG3'.

From fragments of the original label on the back of the case there is a handwritten '3R' where R is ohms, and a printed '0.22 A' crossed out and handwritten over '0.39 A'.
