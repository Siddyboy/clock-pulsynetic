# Notes on Original Clock

Notes about original clock or as inherited from CJCK.

## Original Clock Details

Face is inscribed with 'EDWARD', 'GLASGOW' and 'PULSYNETIC'.

Mechanism and case are inscribed 'EG3'.

From fragments of the original label on the back of the case there is a handwritten '3R' where R is ohms, and a printed '0.22 A' crossed out and handwritten over '0.38 A'.

Hour hand is a friction push-fit. Minute hand is a tapered pin fit.

Scribe mark in bezel is almost certainly TDC (12 O'clock) mark.

The three screws that attach the face to the case are specially filed. Metric?

## Existing retrofit electronics

Clock has bee fitted with 2 off battery holders for D or C cells (TBC).

There are two push buttons but not certain what they do.

Control circuit has one DIL IC = PIC16F84-04/P 0119H7A, a transistor 2N3053 90 08, and another transistor(?) CBC549 8.

There is some sort of crystal oscillator too.

Full circuit TBD.
