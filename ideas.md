Use arduino - what size - to fit inside clock case.

With RTC - to keep 15 second intervals accurate?

No need to have wifi or any connection to NTP server - clock does not need to know the absolute time.
Unless it has to know when DST starts and ends.

If time needs adjusting for odd small adjustments we need a forwards and backward button?

What about DST? How to make it move forward/backward one hour? More buttons? how to automate that?

Use time alarms library.

Most likely mains powered? Or at least a wallwart

## Clock Detail Notes

Face is inscribed with 'EDWARD', 'GLASGOW' and 'PULSYNETIC'.

Mechanism and case are inscribed 'EG3'.

From fragments of the original label on the back of the case there is a handwritten '3R' where R is ohms, and a printed '0.22 A' crossed out and handwritten over '0.39 A'.
