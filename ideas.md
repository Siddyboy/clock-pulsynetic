Use arduino - what size - to fit inside clock case.

With RTC - to keep 15 second intervals accurate?

No need to have wifi or any connection to NTP server - clock does not need to know the absolute time.
Unless it has to know when DST starts and ends.

If time needs adjusting for odd small adjustments we need a forwards and backward button?

What about DST? How to make it move forward/backward one hour? More buttons? how to automate that?

Use time alarms library.

Most likely mains powered? Or at least a wallwart
